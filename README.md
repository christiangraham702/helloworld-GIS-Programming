# Hello World Webpage Project Hello! 
## GIS Programming- Spring 2024
## Christian Graham

I'm a student currently learning about GitHub, GitHub Codespaces, and GitHub Pages. This repository contains my first project: a simple "Hello World" webpage. It's a part of our GIS programming lab where we're exploring the basics of web development and version control. 

## Project Description 
1. Created a GitHub repository to understand how version control works.
2. Used GitHub Codespaces for editing and writing the HTML code for the webpage.
3. Explored basic HTML and CSS to style the webpage.
4. Published the webpage using GitHub Pages. 

## Files in the Repository 

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the "Hello World" webpage. It contains the structure and content of the webpage. 
- `README.md`: This file, providing details about the project and the learning process.
